summary: I am a recent graduate from Conestoga College in Information Technology Business Analysis. I had been working as a Social Media Analyst for almost 
two and half years after the completion of my bachleor degree in Computer Science & Information Technology in Nepal. It is also one of the reason for continuing my 
higher degree in IT here in Canada. I wanted to develop my professional growth with deep level understanding of Information Technology Management. 
Currently, I have joined Jarvis as a BSA where I have been learning advanced software technologies. I have been receiving practical experience with a wide range 
of data analysis technologies as well as knowledge of the agile project management lifecycle methodology. I strive to make a difference in organization with quality
decision-making skill resulting satisfactory output.
In conclusion, I am excited and looking forward to make a difference working in challenging project ensuring success with a team effort.

  - name: "Python Data Analytics"
    git_url: "/python_data_anlytics"
    description: The project was about delivering analytical result via solving business queries of LSG.Our team was responsible for delivering a proof of concept (POC) project that helps the LGS marketing by analyzing customer shopping behaviour due to lack of growth in their revenue in recent years. In addition to the issues, LGS lacked enough IT resources to tackle the problem. So, with the help of our analytical services, we'll be helping LGS to develop marketing strategies through our analytical reports. The main tools were Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Dataframe, and Numpy for the PoC project. As a Junior developer I was responsible to solve LGS business queries. I used dbeaver to work on the sql queries for
    LGS. I ran Jupyter notebook on my remote environment using docker in my desktop. the analytic result will be delivered to LGS via Jupyter Notebook and Github.
