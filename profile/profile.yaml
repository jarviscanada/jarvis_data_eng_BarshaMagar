My other major tasks included planning strategies for the campaigns,organizing promotion events for the brand. I have experience dealing with client requirements, analyzing social media coverage ofbusiness. However, I wanted to enhance my professional growth with deep level undestanding of Information Technology Management. Based upon my past work experience, I realized to advance my career in expert level, Business System Analyst is the next step for my career. Currently, I have joined Jarvis as a BSA where I got to work on different projects that helped me improve my technical skills such as SQL query, RDBMS, Python, etc required for this role. My experience working with wide range of data analysis technologies in an agile/scrum framework helped to build my skills. Now, I want to leverage my experiences I have received and get hands-on BSA experience starting from a entry-level role.

    description: The project was about delivering analytical result via solving business queries of LSG.Our team was responsible for delivering a proof of concept (POC) project that helps the LGS marketing by analyzing customer shopping behaviour due to lack of growth in their revenue in recent years. In addition to the issues, LGS lacked enough IT resources to tackle the problem. So, with the help of our analytical services, we'll be helping LGS to develop marketing strategies through our analytical reports. The main tools were Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Dataframe, and Numpy for the PoC project. As a Junior developer I was responsible to solve LGS business queries. I used dbeaver to work on the sql queries for LGS. I ran Jupyter notebook on my remote environment using docker in my desktop. the analytic result will be delivered to LGS via Jupyter Notebook and Github.
