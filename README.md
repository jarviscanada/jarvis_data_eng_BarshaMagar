# Barsha Layo Magar . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from Conestoga College in Information Technology Business Analysis. I worked as Social Media Analyst for two and half years after my completion of Bachelor Degress in Computer Science and Information Technology in Nepal. My major responsibilities was to maintain Public Relations with different kinds of customers. I enjoyed my role and responsibilities, which is one of the reason for me to pursue my career in an advanced level as a BSA. I wanted to enhance my professional growth with deep level undestanding of Information Technology Management. Currently, I have joined Jarvis as a BSA where I got to work on different projects that helped me improve my technical skills such as SQL query, RDBMS, Python, etc required for this role. My experience working with wide range of data analysis technologies in an agile/scrum framework helped to build my skills. I strive to make a difference in company starting my journey through junior level BSA role.
